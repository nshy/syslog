Archlinux system upgrage goes wrong. Fonts in xterm became unpleasant (i use
dejavu sans mono). The reason turned out to be the fontconfig preset changes
(/etc/fonts/conf.d). Solution: unlink '10-hinting-slight.conf'

After switching colemak to qwerty and back via setxkbmap
my "Menu" key lost its Mod4 ability. Next command will
restore it back:

 > xmodmap -e "keycode  135 = Super_R"

By the way next commands switch between colemak and
qwerty configs (with my default X11 keyboard config).

1. switch to qwerty
 > setxkbmap -variant ","
2. switch back to colemak
 > setxkbmap -variant "colemak,"
